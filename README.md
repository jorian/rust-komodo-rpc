# rust-komodo-rpc

A continuation of komodorpc-rust-client, heavily inspired by 

### Goals
- Learn Rust
  - workspaces
- Simplify codebase
- Do more than just be a RPC lib
- Focus on CC support to understand CC

### Questions
- Why is there a Queryable trait?
- `pub mod serde_hex` returns a `FromHex`, which is a trait. But the trait
doesn't specifically say it's a Vec<u8>. How does this work? 
Is it because `FromHex` is `Sized` it could be anything, 
as long as it is `Sized`? 

### TODO
- [x] Localize coin installations
- [ ] Error types
  - look into [snafu](https://docs.rs/snafu/0.1.4/snafu/)
- [x] create space for json return value deserialization into Types
- [ ] Logging
- [x] komodo crate with komodo tools
- [ ] start adding more structure in json workspace
- [x] deserialize from string into hex type
- [ ] fork bitcoin script to include CC
